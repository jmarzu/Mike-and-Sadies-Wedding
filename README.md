2. Make sure npm is installed.

From the npms docs, if you have downloaded Node.js then you automatically have npm installed on your machine.

check the versions of each by typing in your terminal window

```
node -v
```

```
npm -v
``` 

2. Make sure nodemon is installed. Nodemon will refresh your browser when the code changes.

```
npm install --g nodemon
```
This will install a global variable, that is ok and as intended.
